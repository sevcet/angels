    <p>Until now, it is still being debated if each person has an angel guiding them, or if an angel guides several people at the same time. There are some readings that claim that God assigns each spiritual being to whomever they will guide and protect. They will report to God accordingly about the behavior of those they are protecting and will present prayers attributed to them.</p>
    <p>The Angelic Kingdom</p>
    <p>These kinds of being reside on a place called the Angelic Kingdom. They attend to the spiritual and emotional needs of the Elemental and Human Kingdom. Their main role is to take care of whomever they were assigned to protect. Through them, beneficial energies come out and spread wonderful effects to people. Each angel has their own specialty when it comes to the quality of the energy they are able to come up with.</p>
    <p>This kind of quality or virtue has their own sound, flame, fragrance and color. For example, there are those that work with Saint Michael the Archangel that specialize in the power of Protection and Faith. Those that work under Archangel Zadkiel emit The Violet Flame of Transmutation. For the spiritual beings that work with Archangel Raphael, they specialize in the forces of Healing and Consecration.</p>

    <p>While The Adoration Flame and Divine Love are the expertise of those that work with Chamuel. For those that work with Jophiel emits the power of Illumination and Enlightened Understanding. Other kinds of this type of spiritual beings specialize in qualities such as Happiness, Opulence, Divine Power, Science, Divine Will, Purity, Hope, Comfort, Beauty, Music, Ministration and a lot more.</p>
    <p>These beings may be likened to rechargeable batteries. By hanging out with their superior or the higher angel assigned to work with them, they will be able to absorb the quality and expertise of their leader. The latter is like a source or stream of the quality they are known for. The other spiritual guides that work with them get that energy and they distribute it accordingly to the people they protect and guide.</p>
