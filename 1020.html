    </p>
    <p>Since the 400s, there have been refinements as to the start and theology of Angels as well as the tutelary spirits. For the eastern and western churches, they believe that these kinds of Angels abide by whatever God tells them to do. They are being given assignment by God as to whom will they protect and guide. These Angels present prayers attributed to the people whom they are protecting and they tell them to God. There is actually a memorial for the guardian Angels that is being celebrated on October 2 that is included on the calendar of saints of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
    <p>This kind of belief that Angels watch among people has been around since the Ancient Greek philosophy. It was then said that God sends spiritual beings to watch over each person that God has created.</p>
