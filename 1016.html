    <p>One of the most notable and significant proof about the existence of Angels are actually the famous Biblical facts about Angels.</p>
    <p>Among the most common questions governing such are the age old questions like What are Angels? How and why were they created? What do Angels do?<br />
      Since time immemorial, man always held a strong and devoted fascination for Angels and similar spiritual beings.</p>
    <p>For centuries, many popular and renowned artists have tried to immortalize the image of Angels on canvas and murals.</p>
 <p>
    </p>
    <p>But it would come as a surprise to many once they get to realize that the Bible describes Angels invoking a much more different description of angles as with how they are typically and artistically rendered or presented, like cute and cuddly babies with wings and draped in white cloth. <br />
      Here are some common Biblical facts about Angels.</p>
    <p>One may not be aware, but the Bible has made 273 references to Angels and although we do not aim to get to each and every one of those descriptions and references, we hope to show some examples that provide proof of Angels in the Bible.</p>
    <p>The first reference can be found in the first book of the Bible, where everything else started – the Book of Genesis.<br />
      In the second chapter of Genesis, it mentions &lsquo;Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished&rsquo; to which the term &lsquo;host&rsquo; refers to the description of God&rsquo;s spiritual messengers commonly known as Angels.</p>
    <p>This is also cross – referenced in the first chapter of the new testament book of Colossians where it says &lsquo;For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>The Bible also provided reference to the fact that Angels were created to live for eternity, as stated in Luke 20:36 .. nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the Angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>One proof that Angels were present when God created the world can be found in Job 38:1-7 where it says that &ldquo;Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said: &lsquo;...Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? ...while the morning stars sang together and all the Angels shouted for joy?&quot;</p>
    <p>It is also a fact that Angels cannot marry or be bethroted to someone as stated in Matthew 22:30 where it says that &lsquo;At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the Angels in heaven.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Angels are also wise and intelligent, as the Old Testament book of  2nd Samuel 14:17 that says &ldquo;Your maidservant said, &lsquo;The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Also in Daniel 9:21-22 while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. He instructed me and said to me, &quot;Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      These are just some of the Biblical facts about Angels and there are even more similar entries you may find in the Bible, so go ahead read and discover.</p>
