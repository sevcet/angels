    <p>People regard them as guardians, for others they are sentinels of good that champion truth and justice, but for most, they are heaven&rsquo;s messengers but do we really know if they really exist, here&rsquo;s how to look at some facts about Angels.</p>
    <p>Since time immemorial, the existence or even just the belief of Angels have captivated and lingered on in the minds and lives of many people.<br />
      They do come in many names from seraphs, archAngels, cherubs, guardian Angels, spirit and messenger among others, but they all are perceived as just one and the same. 
         
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many claim to have had &lsquo;real&rsquo; experiences with Angels, mostly in a spiritual nature and believe that their existence is as important to us as human beings in need of spiritual guidance and protection, especially with the notion of a higher spiritual being or deity that exists to appeal to a man&rsquo;s need for a higher being.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no definite information that teaches us how Angels first existed, but it surely can be traced back to the history of man and the stories that come along with it.</p>
    <p>They have been commonly perceived as spiritual messengers of a supreme divine entity, for which traditions and beliefs usually debates as to whether Angels have their own free will or are just out to follow the supreme entity&rsquo;s will.</p>
    <p>Although many believe that Angels carry on various appearances, depending on a people&rsquo;s culture, tradition or belief, however, it does have one common denominator, that it takes on the shape of a human being.<br />
      This is mainly so because most people believe that Angels were previously humans in an earlier life and took on the form of an angel after passing over to the afterlife.</p>
 <p>
    </p>
    <p>Over time, different religious cultures have their own ideas and beliefs regarding the existence and characteristics of Angels, from Christianity to Judaism and mostly every other religious discipline and has developed concepts of various similarities that make the concept of Angels popularly held across all cultures.</p>
    <p>Most of these principles revolve on a common principle of a &lsquo;messenger&rsquo; tasked to do the work of a deity.</p>
    <p>But in most cases, the most popular concept of Angels are held strongly by the Christian faith.</p>
    <p>This is strongly evidenced in Biblical scriptures that lend proof of their existence as messengers of God and has since then gained popular following among many devout Christians.</p>
    <p>A similar traditional belief has is also being mentioned in post-Biblical Judaism, with almost similarÂ  significance and principles as that of the Christian faith. >
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It was believed that early Christians inherited the Jewish idea of Angels and in the early stages of Christianity, the concept held of an angel took a different twist as Angels being messengers of God and a reflection or manifestation of God.</p>
    <p>As time passed, Angels then came to be individual messengers of God, with among those most commonly identified as Michael and Gabriel, among many others.</p>
    <p>These angelic descriptions later took shape through studies in theology and popular art and centuries later, church leaders declared that Angels belonged to different categories, with specific activities and missions that were assigned to them.</p>
    <p>Other popularly held concepts of Angels are carried on throughout the Christian world and has earned the respect of many Christians, regardless of whether Angels exist in real to make contact with people or not.<br />
      But one thing&rsquo;s for sure, these facts about Angels are as important as our understanding of faith.</p>
